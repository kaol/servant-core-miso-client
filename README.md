# `servant-core-miso-client`

This is an implementation of the `servant-client-core` API on top of
[Miso](https://haskell-miso.org/). It doesn't share code with
`servant-miso-client`.

The library should be usable without using Miso for your program in a
WASM environment.  Tested only with WASM and may not do anything
useful with GHCJS.

# Usage

TBD. Similar to `servant-jsaddle`.
